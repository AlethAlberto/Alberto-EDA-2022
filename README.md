### Abstract

Mental health is very important to a persons overall health and well-being. Mental health is composed of emotional, physiological, and social aspects of our lives. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes to our lives whether it be work, school, the ability to leave the house, etc. As a result of these changes, our emotional, psychological health, as well as our social lives have been impacted, and not necessarily for the better. We are interested in how the COIVD-19 pandemic has affected Adult's overall mental health and well-being.

Our results may help us understand the effect of COVID-19 on young adult's mental health in the US, and suggest ways to improve public health responses in the future.
