Abstract Mental health is very important to a person's overall health and well-being. Mental health is composed of emotional, physiological, and social aspects of our lives. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes to our lives whether it be work, school, the ability to leave the house, etc. As a result of these changes, our emotional, and psychological health, as well as our social lives have been impacted, and not necessarily for the better. We are interested in how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Adults' overall mental health and well-being. To address this topic, we will explore data from the US census website (data on poverty), the USDA website (for SNAP data), SAMHSA website (for Major Depressive Episode data), as well as KFF.org (for other MDE data).
