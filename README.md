Mental health is very important to a persons overall health and well-being. Mental health is composed of emotional, physiological, and social aspects of our lives. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes to our lives whether it be work, school, the ability to leave the house, etc. As a result of these changes, our emotional, psychological health, as well as our social lives have been impacted, and not necessarily for the better.   We are interested in how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected teens and young adult's overall mental health and well-being. To address this topic, we will explore data from KIDS COUNTÂ®, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation which surveys children and families annually across the United States. We will look for relationships between risk factors, such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders, and mental health outcomes.
